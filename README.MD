I learned how to implement OAuth2 authentication in modern web applications through this project. It covers the integration of OAuth2 with popular platforms like GitHub and 
Google, enabling secure user authentication and authorization. By using Spring Boot on the backend and React on the frontend, I gained experience in setting up and configuring 
OAuth2 clients, handling user data, and managing tokens.
